# Reflection

## What we're proud of

We’re proud of some of the advanced features that were implemented. For example, when someone replies to a user’s post, the owner of the post receives an in-app real-time notification alerting them. Similarly, users can request a password reset and be provided with an email to do so. Also, the match confirm/deny page has a complex swiping functionality akin to a Tinder or other matching apps. The overall UI is something that we’re proud of because we transformed it from a basic Bootstrap application to a professional looking application. The search and filter feature was also an accomplishment of ours because it took a long time to complete and came out really nicely. We’re proud of the rigorous testing we put our application through to ensure a high quality product: both when deploying and to test parts of the application in development. In general, we’re all proud of the great application we developed and hope to see it benefit our community!

## Future steps

If we had more time, we would have added more interesting features and gems to improve the application: Google Maps API, more stimulus reflex, Factory_Girl, and Globalize. Globalize would especially be cool so that way we could help all communities, and not just those that speak english. We also would have added some badges and achievements for users when they accomplished some milestones: replying to a certain number of users, matching a certain number of times, etc. Also, some sort of simple machine learning to find relevant posts for users. For example, if 90% of the time a user comments on specifically financial literacy posts, we could make those types the top posts for them to see and even recommend them.
